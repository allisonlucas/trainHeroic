# trainHeroic

For this test challenge, I decided to learn and use Protractor. The TrainHeroic application is built using AngularJS. Protractor provides Angular-specific locator strategies for interacting with DOM elements. Additionally, Protractor provides automatic waiting, which eliminates the need to wait for the test and webpage to sync.
